# [2.2.6](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-swift/releases/tag/2.2.3) - 16 Nov 2022

### ‚úÖ Added
- Add `ActivityReactionsOptions` in `Client.get<T: ActivityProtocol>`. Enable ability to get activities with reaction data.

# [2.2.2](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-swift/releases/tag/2.2.2) - 24 Feb 2020

### üêû Fixed
- `ISO8601DateFormatter.Options.withFractionalSeconds` option for `ISO8601DateFormatter` causes an exception in iOS11 (fixed in iOS11.2) [#24](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-swift/pull/24)

# [2.2.1](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-swift/releases/tag/2.2.1) - 20 Dec 2019

# [2.2.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-swift/releases/tag/2.2.0) - 20 Dec 2019

### üí• Breaking Changes
The `Client` will always work as a shared instance and you can setup it without a user token:
```swift
Client.config = .init(apiKey: "<#ApiKey#>", appId: "<#AppId#>")
```
The user setup is more clear. You can easily manage user login/logout:
```swift
Client.shared.setupUser(token: token) { _ in 
    // Do all your requests from here. Reload feeds and etc.
}
```
No need to send to create a Stream user request for new users.

You can use custom User type with an additional user parameter. For example:
```swift
let myUser = MyUser(id: "123", name: "John Doe", avatarURL: avatarURL)
Client.shared.setupUser(myUser, token: token) { _ in 
    print(MyUser.current)
}
```

### ‚úÖ Added
- Custom JSON Encoder/Decoder. You can change `JSONDecoder.default` and `JSONEncoder.default`.

### üîÑ Changed
- `ClientError.parameterInvalid(AnyKeyPath)` > `ClientError.parameterInvalid(String)`

### üêû Fixed
- Xcode 10 support
- Cached `ISO8601DateFormatter`.
