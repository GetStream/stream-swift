for Swift 5:
```
pod 'GetStream', '~> 2.0'

Then run `pod install`.

In any file you'd like to use Stream in, don't forget to import the framework with `import GetStream`.

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:
```
.package(url: "https://github.com/GetStream/stream-swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
```

### Carthage

Make the following entry in your Cartfile:
```
github "GetStream/stream-swift"
```
Then run `carthage update`.

## Quick start

```swift
// Setup a shared Stream client.
Client.config = .init(apiKey: "<#ApiKey#>", appId: "<#AppId#>", token: "<#Token#>")

// Setup a Stream current user with the userId from the Token.
Client.shared.createCurrentUser() { _ in 
    // Do all your requests from here. Reload feeds and etc.
}

// Create a user feed.
let userFeed = Client.shared.flatFeed(feedSlug: "user")

// Create an Activity. You can make own Activity class or struct with custom properties.
let activity = Activity(actor: User.current!, verb: "add", object: "picture:10", foreignId: "picture:10")

userFeed?.add(activity) { result in
    // A result of the adding of the activity.
    print(result)
}

// Create a following relationship between "timeline" feed and "user" feed:
let timelineFeed = Client.shared.flatFeed(feedSlug: "timeline")

timelineFeed?.follow(toTarget: userFeed!.feedId, activityCopyLimit: 1) { result in
    print(result)
}

// Read timeline and user's post appears in the feed:
timelineFeed?.get(pagination: .limit(10)) { result in
    let response = try! result.get()
    print(response.results)
}

// Remove an activity by referencing it's foreignId
userFeed?.remove(foreignId: "picture:10") { result in
    print(result)
}
```
